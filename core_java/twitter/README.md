# Twitter CLI Application

## <ins>Introduction
The `Twitter Command Line Interface (CLI) Application` is capable of
posting, showing, and deleting a post on Twitter using the command line. 
Libraries such as `HTTP` and `OAuth 1.0` were used to send/receive/authenticate
requests using the Twitter Rest APIs. The Jackson library was used to convert JSON 
objects to Tweet objects. Moreover, Apache Maven was used to handle project 
dependencies, testing was done using `JUnit4` and `Mockito`, and the app was deployed 
using Docker

__Targeted User:__ The product can be used by anyone who would like
to post | show | delete a tweet using command line interface. It 
will be especially useful for people who post regularly on Twitter

__Technologies:__

## <ins> Quick Start
Pull image from Docker

`docker pull deelango/twittercli`

Obtain your 
   <span style = "color:blue"> consumerKey </span> |
   <span style = "color:blue"> consumerSecret </span> |
   <span style = "color:blue"> accessToken </span> |
   <span style = "color:blue"> tokenSecret </span>
   from Twitter Developer's Portal
```
docker run --rm \
-e consumerKey= null \
-e consumerSecret= null \
-e accessToken= null \
-e tokenSecret= null \
deelango/twittercli post|show|delete [options]
```

#### Post
```
docker run --rm \
-e consumerKey= null \
-e consumerSecret= null \
-e accessToken= null \
-e tokenSecret= null \
deelango/twittercli post "message" latitude:longitude
```
#### Show 
```
docker run --rm \
-e consumerKey= null \
-e consumerSecret= null \
-e accessToken= null \
-e tokenSecret= null \
deelango/twittercli show id_of_tweet
```
#### Delete
```
docker run --rm \
-e consumerKey= null \
-e consumerSecret= null \
-e accessToken= null \
-e tokenSecret= null \
deelango/twittercli delete id_of_tweet
```

#### Description of the components
The application consists of four major components:

- `TwitterCLIApp`: 
   When the user communicates with the command line, this script is
   responsible for calling the Post | Show | Delete methods in 
  `TwitterController`. In addition, this script is also responsible for 
   creating an instance of`TwitterController`, `TwitterDao`, `TwitterHttpHelper`,
   and`TwitterService`


- `TwitterController`:
   The data that is sent from the `TwitterCLIApp` will be 
   validated to see if its in an acceptable format before sending it over
   to `TwitterService` where it will be parsed for logic errors. The 
   final result will be then sent back to `TwitterCLIApp` where it will
   be outputted to the user
  

- `TwitterService`:
  This class is responsible for analyzing the data with respect to 
  the Business logic that was established before development. 
  Only if the data passes the validation, it is sent to
  `TwitterDao` where it will communicate with Twitter

 
- `TwitterDao`:
  The data access layer is responsible for handling the models to initiate 
  communication with the Twitter's servers. It does this with the help
  of its `TwitterHttpHelper` class as well as by constructing 
  the URI for request calls

  
## <ins> Model
The following diagram will illustrate the `Tweet` model and its dependencies 
[`Coordinates`, `Entities`, `Hashtags`, and `UserMentions`]

## <ins> Spring
The biggest challenge in the project had to do with dependency management.
With each class having its own dependencies, it can become rather inefficient
to create each component and set up their dependencies manually. 


I opted to go with the Spring Framework so that all the dependencies can
be managed by the concept of Inversion of Control (IOC). The main classes 
were annotated `@Component` <span style = "color:blue">[TwitterHttpHelper] [TwitterCLIApp], 
`@Controller` [TwitterController],`@Service` [TwitterService],
</span> and <span style = "color:blue">`@Repository` [TwitterDao] </span> as well as  placing `@Autowire` before 
all the constructors to indicate that the class is a `Bean` and to notify
the IoC container to inject any dependencies through the constructor.





## <ins> Test
Testing for each module was done using `Junit4` and `Mockito`. For each
component an integration and unit test was performed to see if
it does what it is supposed to do
