  "summary": "Electrical Engineering had taught me that even the most complicated problems could be solved by one consistently educating yourself and by two breaking it down into smaller pieces. As a Junior Data Engineer at Jarvis, I was able to participate in various challenging projects using an Agile/Scrum framework that allowed me to become proficient in technologies like Java, Git, SQL, Bash, Maven, and Docker. My interest in the Software Engineering field stemmed from a basic heart-beat alarm clock that I made for my mom's birthday, something about the process of solving a complex problem by writing a few lines of code on the computer made me fall in love with the field. Over the next few years, I would go on to teach myself data structures, algorithms, and programming through various personal projects. *[**Portfolio:**  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k76_DsM81lgf7jHYU-8jScSd8Mnhv7kO?usp=sharing]*"
