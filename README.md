# Deepak Elango . Jarvis Consulting

Electrical Engineering had taught me that even the most complicated problems could be solved by one consistently educating yourself and by two breaking it down into smaller pieces. As a Junior Data Engineer at Jarvis, I was able to participate in various challenging projects using an Agile/Scrum framework that allowed me to become proficient in technologies like Java, Git, SQL, Bash, Maven, and Docker. My interest in the Software Engineering field stemmed from a basic heart-beat alarm clock that I made for my mom's birthday, something about the process of solving a complex problem by writing a few lines of code on the computer made me fall in love with the field. Over the next few years, I would go on to teach myself data structures, algorithms, and programming through various personal projects. *[**Portfolio:**  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k76_DsM81lgf7jHYU-8jScSd8Mnhv7kO?usp=sharing]*

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DeepakElango](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DeepakElango)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DeepakElango/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Cluster Monitoring Agent for the Linux Cluster Administration Team at Jarvis to monitor and gather data on hardware and resource usage in their system. This provided valuable information for the team as they can now analyze and derive solutions from analyzing the data to efficiently allocate resources in the future. The project was designed, implemented, tested, and deployed with; *Git, Docker, Bash Scripts, CentOS 7, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud Platform*.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DeepakElango/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: 
  - JDBC App: Constructed the JDBC application to perform CRUD operations using DAO and DTO design patterns on a PostgreSQL retail store's database. 
  - Grep App: Created the Java Grep Application which is an implementation of the Linux Grep command which search for a string of characters in a given directory and ouputs them to another file. The application was created with Java SE 8 Lambda/Steam API's with Apache Maven and deployed using Docker.
